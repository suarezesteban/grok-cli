# 🚀 Grok CLI (The Maintenance Fork)

This is the **community-led, high-performance maintenance fork** of the original Grok CLI. Since the upstream repository (`superagent-ai/grok-cli`) is no longer maintained and failed to work with the latest xAI API changes, I have completely overhauled it to support the **modern xAI Responses API**.

## 🌟 Why this fork?

- **✅ Fixed & Alive**: The original OpenAI SDK-based implementation is broken for latest models. This fork uses the latest `/v1/responses` API.
- **🔍 Native Search**: First-class support for `web_search` and `x_search` tools.
- **🧠 Grok-3 & 4-1 Ready**: Optimized for the latest `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `grok-3` models.
- **⚡ Performance**: Lightweight implementation with axios for maximum reliability.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Global Installation
Install the fixed version directly from my personal NPM scope:

```bash
# Using Bun (Recommended)
bun add -g @kazuki-ookura/grok-cli

# Using NPM
npm install -g @kazuki-ookura/grok-cli
```

### Installation from Source (for Developers)
If you want to contribute or use the latest source code:

```bash

## 📈 Status & Future

The original project at `superagent-ai/grok-cli` appears to be abandoned. I've taken the initiative to keep this project alive because it's a fantastic tool for developers. Expect regular updates as the Grok API evolves.
